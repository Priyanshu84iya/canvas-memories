## 📖 About The Project

**Canvas & Memories** is a web-based drag-and-drop collage creator. Unlike static photo grids, this project mimics a real-life messy desk or corkboard. It allows users to scatter their photos freely, write handwritten notes, and immerse themselves in a creative environment.

It features a **Day/Night toggle** that not only changes the color palette but introduces **ambient rain sounds** for a cozy, focus-friendly atmosphere.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📸 Polaroid Aesthetics:** Images are automatically framed with a white border and shadow.
* **🖐️ Drag & Drop:** Free-form movement of images and notes anywhere on the canvas.
* **✏️ Editable Captions:** Type directly onto the polaroids or sticky notes using a handwriting font.
* **📝 Sticky Notes:** Add yellow post-it notes for text-only reminders or quotes.
* **🌙 Night Mode & Ambience:** Switch to a "Deep Space" theme that triggers soothing rain sounds.
* **💾 Save as Image:** Export your entire arrangement as a high-quality `.png` file.
* **📱 Responsive Design:** Works beautifully on desktop and tablet screens.
